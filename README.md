## Motivation, Goals, and Disclaimers

This personal project aims to explore ideas on symbolic programming and how to implement
those ideas in Modern C++ efficiently. I started this project to educate myself on techniques for expression trees and term rewrite systems. 

There is no long-term initiative to maintain and continuously develop this code.
